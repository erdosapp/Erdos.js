# What is this?

Erdos is a mathematical expression parser and evaluator. It can take expressions like $25 + 10% sales tax
and evaluate them. *Note*: It is not done nor functional yet. Feel free to look around though.

Erdos was forked from [mathjs](http://mathjs.org/) a JS math library by Jos de Jong
